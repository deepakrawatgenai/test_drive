### 💬 **Simulated Conversation: Toyota AI Agent with Customer Rahul**

**Agent (AI Bot):**
Hi Rahul! 👋 Welcome to Toyota SmartDrive Assistant.
I can help you explore Toyota cars, compare features, check availability near you, and even schedule a test drive.
What kind of car are you looking for today — a sedan, SUV, or hybrid?

---

**Customer (Rahul):**
Hey! I’m looking for a stylish SUV, maybe something like the Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.

---

**Agent:**
Great choice, Rahul! 🚙
The **Toyota RAV4 Hybrid 2025** is known for its 2.5L engine, 219 hp, and an impressive 41 MPG city mileage.
Let me quickly check which trims are available near your ZIP code — may I have your ZIP?

---

**Customer:**
Sure, it’s 90012.

---

**Agent (calls inventory_tool):**
Thanks! Checking dealerships near 90012...

✅ The **RAV4 Hybrid XLE** and **RAV4 Hybrid Limited** are available at **Toyota Downtown LA** and **North Hollywood Toyota**.
However, the **RAV4 Hybrid XSE** (sport trim) isn’t currently in stock.

Would you like to explore one of the available trims, or should I show similar models with comparable features?

---

**Customer:**
Hmm, I was more interested in the XSE because of its sporty look.
Any other SUV with similar styling?

---

**Agent (calls serper_tool + feature_match_tool):**
Got it 👍 The **Toyota Venza XLE** has a similar sporty design, panoramic roof, and hybrid powertrain.
It’s slightly more premium and available at your nearest dealer.
Would you like me to compare it with the RAV4 XSE for you?

---

**Customer:**
Yes, please.

---

**Agent:**
Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature      | RAV4 XSE            | Venza XLE         |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Engine       | 2.5L Hybrid         | 2.5L Hybrid       |
| Mileage      | 40 MPG              | 39 MPG            |
| Drive        | AWD                 | AWD               |
| Interior     | Sporty Black SofTex | Premium SofTex    |
| Infotainment | 10.5” Touchscreen   | 12.3” Touchscreen |

The **Toyota Venza XLE** and **RAV4 XSE** are both great choices, Rahul!
Would you like to **schedule a test drive for either one**, or are you **interested in exploring some other cars too?**
